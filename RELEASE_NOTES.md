# v2.1 Release Notes: The "No Slop" Update

We listened to the feedback. ARC v2.0 was too "Vibe Coded." v2.1 is engineered.

## 🔥 Top Critical Fixes

*   **Fixed "Works on My Machine":**
    *   Removed all hardcoded `/home/user/` paths.
    *   `./dash` is now a portable relative launcher.
    *   MCP Bridge now auto-detects the correct `python3` executable.
*   **Documentation Overhaul:**
    *   Deleted 100% of the "AI Sales Speak" (No more "Singularity", "Testament", "Delve").
    *   Renamed "Alpha/Beta/Gamma" agents to standard **Researcher / Coder / Auditor**.
    *   Added a concrete **"To-Do App" Tutorial** in the README.
*   **Architecture Transparency:**
    *   New `HOW_IT_WORKS.md` explains the "Fresh Process" architecture used to solve Context Rot.
    *   Admitted the ~20% hallucination rate in "Operational Realities".

## 🛠️ Integration Support
*   Added comprehensive guides for **Antigravity**, **Claude Desktop**, **VS Code (Roo)**, and **Copilot**.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1.  `python3 setup_arc.py`
2.  `./dash`
3.  Connect your IDE.

*Thank you to the Reddit community for the brutal honesty. We needed it.*
