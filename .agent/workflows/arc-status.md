description: Show current ARC status
---

Show me my current project status:

0. **Dashboard Info**:
   - Run `./venv/bin/python3 .agent/dashboard/update.py main_status="STATUS" main_action="Checking Project Health" log="Generating status report..."`

1. Read .arc/PROJECT.md
2. Read .arc/ROADMAP.md  
3. Read .arc/STATE.md

Tell me:
- Project name and goal
- Phases completed ✅
- Current phase (if any)
- Next phase
- Any blockers or decisions needed

Format it clearly so I can see progress at a glance.
