# Landing Page for DevSecOps Tool

## Vision
Create a visually striking landing page that showcases a DevSecOps tool idea for a hackathon — fast to build and high visual polish to attract attention.

## Core Goal
Deliver a beautiful, responsive static landing page that communicates the product vibe and key value propositions.

## Non-Goals
Not building a working backend or production integration in v1; no authentication or data persistence.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] A single static HTML page loads correctly in major browsers
- [ ] Design is visually appealing (hero, features, CTA)
- [ ] Content clearly communicates the idea to students and developers

## Tech Stack
HTML, CSS (static assets only)

## Key Constraints
10 minutes to produce an initial landing page; focus on visuals over functionality.
