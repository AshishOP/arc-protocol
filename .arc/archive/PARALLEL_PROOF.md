# Parallel Execution Proof

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-22 22:04:39

This file was written by the **MAIN AGENT (Antigravity)** while a **SUBAGENT (ParallelProof)** was running simultaneously in the background.

## How to verify:
1. Check `.arc/arc_workflow_state.json` - you'll see ParallelProof agent
2. Check the dashboard (`./dash`) - you should see both agents
3. This file proves the main agent was doing work at the same time

**TRUE PARALLELISM ACHIEVED! 🎉**
