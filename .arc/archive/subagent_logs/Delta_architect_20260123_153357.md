# Output from Delta (Skill: architect)

**Task:** Review directory structure for ARC Protocol

**Model:** flash

---

I will begin by listing the contents of the `.agent/` and `.arc/` directories to understand the current structural organization and file distribution.
I will now examine the `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` files to identify any documented architectural principles, and I'll also list the contents of the `.arc/planning` and `.arc/state` directories to understand how the protocol manages its lifecycle and current status.
I will now check the `.arc/templates/` directory to understand the intended file structure and standard document formats.
I'll now examine the `.agent/workflows` directory to understand how the templates are utilized and how data flows between the agents and the filesystem.
I'll read `arc-new.md` and `arc-plan.md` to determine their expected file output locations.
I'll now examine the contents of the `.agent/skills/` directory to understand how skills are defined and structured.
I'll list the contents of the `definitions` directory within `.agent/skills/`.
I'll list the contents of the `.agent/tools` directory.
I'll list the contents of the `.agent/workers` directory.
I will read the `.arc/templates/CONTRACTS.md` file to understand the standard format for defining API and data interfaces.
I'll read the `MCP_TEST.md`, `PARALLEL_PROOF.md`, and `SUBAGENT_PROOF.md` files in the `.arc/` directory to see if they provide any context for the missing files.
I'll search for `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` in the root directory to identify the project's dependencies and configuration.
I'll examine `.agent/dashboard/monitor.py` to identify the libraries it uses, which should give me a clue about the project's dependencies.
Based on my architectural review of the ARC Protocol's directory structure, I have identified several inconsistencies and opportunities for better organization and scalability.

### **ARC Protocol: Proposed Architectural Structure**

To ensure consistency across workflows and improve the scalability of the protocol, I recommend normalizing the file structure as follows:

#### **1. The `.arc/` Specification (Context & Persistence)**
The source of truth for the project. Core files should be stabilized to prevent "context drift" between different agents.

*   **`.arc/PROJECT.md`**: Core vision, goals, and high-level constraints. (Source: `templates/PROJECT.md`)
*   **`.arc/ROADMAP.md`**: Phase-level milestones and tracking. (Source: `templates/ROADMAP.md`)
*   **`.arc/CONTRACTS.md`**: Single source of truth for APIs, data models, and conventions.
*   **`.arc/planning/`**: 
    *   `phase-[N]-PLAN.md`: Granular task breakdown for the active phase.
    *   `phase-[N]-CONTEXT.md`: Raw requirements and research gathered during `/arc-discuss`.
*   **`.arc/state/`**:
    *   `STATE.md`: Human-readable summary of progress for session resume/pause.
    *   `runtime.json`: (Formerly `arc_workflow_state.json`) Machine-readable state for the TUI Dashboard.
*   **`.arc/archive/`**:
    *   `reports/`: Stamped logs from subagent executions (e.g., `Beta_coder_20260123...md`).
    *   `phases/`: Completed phase plans for historical reference.

#### **2. The `.agent/` Engine (Runtime & Logic)**
The implementation layer for agentic behavior.

*   **`workflows/`**: Categorized slash-command logic (e.g., `lifecycle/`, `execution/`, `utility/`).
*   **`skills/`**: Domain-specific capability definitions and prompts.
*   **`mcp/`**: Model Context Protocol server for unified tool access.
*   **`dashboard/`**: Textual TUI monitoring system.
*   **`workers/`**: Background process daemons for parallel subagents.

### **Immediate Recommendations**

1.  **Documentation Reconciliation**: The `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` currently point to different paths for `ROADMAP.md` and `STATE.md`. I recommend consolidating all "Core Identity" files (Project, Roadmap, Contracts) in the root of `.arc/` and all "Ephemeral/Execution" files in `planning/` or `state/`.
2.  **Dependency Specification**: Add a `requirements.txt` to the root. While a `venv/` exists, the lack of a manifest file makes the environment non-reproducible.
3.  **State File Migration**: Move `arc_workflow_state.json` to `.arc/state/runtime.json` to align with the proposed organization.
4.  **Meta-ARC Initialization**: This project (the protocol itself) should have its own `.arc/PROJECT.md` and `ROADMAP.md` populated to demonstrate the protocol's self-hosting capability.

I have completed my review of the directory structure. I am ready to assist with implementing these structural refinements or defining the data models for the `CONTRACTS.md`.
