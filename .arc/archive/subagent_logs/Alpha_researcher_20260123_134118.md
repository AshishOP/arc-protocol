# Output from Alpha (Skill: researcher)

**Task:** Hello

**Model:** default

---

I am Alpha, your Technical Researcher. I'm ready to assist with gathering information, summarizing project context, or researching specific technologies for the ARC Protocol.

To get started, I'll examine the project's core documentation to understand our current objectives.

I'll start by reading the project's README, CLAUDE.md, and completion status to understand the current state of the ARC Protocol and its development.

I've completed my initial research on the **ARC (Analyze, Run, Confirm) Protocol**. Here is a summary of the current project state:

### TL;DR
The project is a high-discipline development framework that enforces a "Neural Architecture" on AI-assisted coding through specialized roles (Architect, Executor, Reviewer) and persistent context via the `.arc/` directory.

### Key Project Components (Sources: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `COMPLETION_STATUS.md`)
- **Workflow Control**: Uses slash commands (e.g., `/arc-plan`, `/arc-execute`) to manage development phases.
- **Context Preservation**: Relies on `PROJECT.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `CONTRACTS.md` as single sources of truth.
- **Dashboard**: A real-time CLI monitor (`.agent/dashboard/monitor.py`) tracks agent activity and metrics.
- **Current Status**: Version 1.0.0 is complete and "READY FOR RELEASE." All core features, including health checks, auto-changelog, and velocity tracking, are implemented.

### Observations
I noticed that while the documentation references `PROJECT.md` and `ROADMAP.md` as key files in the `.arc/` directory, they were not immediately visible in the initial file listing. I will verify their existence to ensure the context is fully synchronized.

### Next Steps
I am ready to:
1.  **Research libraries/APIs** if you're adding new features.
2.  **Summarize context** for any "Brownfield" additions.
3.  **Explain "How-to"** for any part of the ARC Protocol itself.

How would you like to proceed?

The `.arc/` directory root is currently missing `PROJECT.md` and `ROADMAP.md`, which are foundational files for the ARC Protocol. I'll check the `.arc/planning` directory to see if they've been moved or if any active plans exist there.

I've confirmed that while the ARC Protocol infrastructure is fully implemented (v1.0.0), the project directory itself is not currently tracking an active development phase (no `PROJECT.md` or `ROADMAP.md` in `.arc/`). 

### Research Summary
- **Current Version**: 1.0.0 (Ready for Release).
- **Environment**: Linux, working in `antigravity_ai`.
- **Infrastructure**: All ARC templates, skills, and dashboard tools are in place.
- **Missing State**: The protocol has not yet been initialized for this specific directory (requires `/arc-new` or manual creation of core `.arc` files).

I am standing by to research any technical requirements for your next phase or to help document a new feature. What's on your mind?

I've completed my research on the current project state. The ARC Protocol is fully implemented at version 1.0.0 and ready for use. I'm standing by for any research tasks or "how-to" inquiries you may have.
