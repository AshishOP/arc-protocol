# Output from Gamma (Skill: auditor)

**Task:** Audit .arc/CONTRACTS.md

**Model:** flash

---

I will list the contents of the `.arc/` directory to verify if `CONTRACTS.md` exists.
I will search for any file named `CONTRACTS.md` in the project to ensure I am auditing the correct file.
I will read the content of `.arc/templates/CONTRACTS.md` to begin the audit.
I will read the `README.md` file to understand how contracts are utilized within the project and identify any specific requirements or standards.
I will search for the string "Contracts & Shared Definitions" across the entire project to see if the contract file exists under a different name.
I will read `.agent/rules/global.md` and `.agent/rules/SUBAGENT_MANIFEST.md` to identify any project-specific naming conventions or standards that I should use for the audit.
I will read `.agent/rules/SUBAGENT_MANIFEST.md` to further understand the roles and responsibilities of the subagents and any additional guidelines.
I will read `.agent/skills/definitions/auditor.md` to see if there are any specific auditing rules or guidelines I should follow.
I will list the contents of the `.arc/planning/` directory to check for any files that might be related to the contracts.
I will attempt to read `.arc/CONTRACTS.md` directly to see if it exists but was ignored in the previous directory listing.
Audit of `.arc/templates/CONTRACTS.md` and ARC Protocol Infrastructure:

### 🚨 Critical Issues
*   **[CRITICAL] File: .arc/CONTRACTS.md - Infrastructure Failure**
    The core contract file `.arc/CONTRACTS.md` is missing from the `.arc/` directory. According to `README.md` and `SUBAGENT_MANIFEST.md`, this is the "Single Source of Truth" and is mandatory for all subagents. Its absence prevents agents from adhering to project standards and breaks the ARC core workflow.

### 🛡️ Security Risks
*   **[HIGH] File: .arc/templates/CONTRACTS.md:46 - Secret Leakage Risk**
    The "Environment Variables" table includes an "Example" column without a security warning. This pattern encourages agents/developers to commit sensitive configuration data (API keys, secrets) to version control.
    *Recommendation:* Add a mandatory disclaimer: `⚠️ NEVER commit real secrets to this file. Use placeholders only.`

### 📋 Contract & Standard Violations
*   **[MEDIUM] File: .arc/templates/CONTRACTS.md:104 - Ambiguous Naming Conventions**
    The "TypeScript" rule specifies `PascalCase` but does not distinguish between Types, Interfaces, and Variables. Standard TS usage requires `camelCase` for variables/properties. This ambiguity will lead to linting errors and inconsistent code.
*   **[MEDIUM] File: .arc/templates/CONTRACTS.md:128 - Non-Specific Timezone Requirement**
    The API date format lists `ISO 8601` but the rule doesn't explicitly mandate UTC (`Z`). This is a common source of data corruption in distributed systems.
*   **[MEDIUM] Project Logic: Concurrent Update Race Condition**
    The instruction "Update this file AS YOU BUILD" in a parallel multi-agent environment (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc.) will result in file-write collisions or git merge conflicts without an established synchronization protocol.

### 🔍 Quality & Maintenance Gaps
*   **[LOW] File: .arc/templates/CONTRACTS.md:15 - Missing API Versioning**
    No convention is defined for API versioning (e.g., `/v1/`), which will complicate future refactoring.
*   **[LOW] File: .arc/templates/CONTRACTS.md:112 - Missing Authentication Standard**
    The "Authentication" section lacks a default recommendation (e.g., Bearer tokens), leading to fragmented auth implementations across different endpoints.
*   **[LOW] File: .arc/templates/CONTRACTS.md:36 - Missing Enum Naming Style**
    Status/Enum values lack a defined case convention (e.g., `snake_case` vs `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`).

### 🛠️ Strategic Recommendation
Initialize `.arc/CONTRACTS.md` immediately by copying the template and adding a "LOCK" or "SYNC" protocol for parallel subagents to prevent data loss during concurrent builds.
